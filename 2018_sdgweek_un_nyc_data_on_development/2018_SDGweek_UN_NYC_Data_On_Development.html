                        But a child mortality rate of 4.5% still means that 11 children die every minute. There is obviously absolutely no reason to be complacent.

                        We did not achieve most of the MDGs.</br>

Overall, the world achieved 3 and a half targets: </br>
– MDG Target 1.A – halving the share of the world population living in extreme poverty.</br>
– MDG 3: the gender disparity in education was closed at the global level. </br>
– MDG Target 6.C on malaria and tuberculosis: achieved as the world was able to reduce the global rate of new infections. </br>
– Half of MDG 7: while the goal for sanitation was missed, the world did reach the goal on providing access to safe drinking water.

                        With this focus, the news fails to show the things that happen every day. The slow things that continuously and persistently change our world.</br></br>
                        To highlight this media failure I wrote this "newspaper" frontpage here. It is a newspaper that could have been published on any day.

                        <p>For many SDGs it is not yet possible to know whether we will reach them, because the target is set for 2030, still 12 years away.</br></br>
                        	There are a several SDGs however for which the goal is set for an earlier deadline. Road deaths are one of the most common causes of deaths for young people. Target 3.6. is to halve the number of global road deaths until 2020 (relative to the level of 2010).</br></br>
                        	Unfortunately we cannot realistically hope that we achieve this goal.

	 Show the SDG Tracker
		Two uses of data:
			Data gets people excited about development (cause the reality is so much more positive than their perception)
			Data can keep governments accountable

                        <small>It is coincidence that I was invited to speak here this week, but it is good timing as we just released the new verion of our website <a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/"><i>'SDG-Tracker.org'</i></a>.</br></br>
                        It is the first publication that allows policy makers and citizens around the world to see how the world is doing on the way to the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030.</br>
