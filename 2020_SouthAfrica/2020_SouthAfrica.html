                    	Every day 15,000 children die. Child mortality is an everyday tragedy of enormous scale that rarely makes the headlines (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-everyday-tragedy-no-headlines">read the post</a>).</br></br>


                    	The newspapers and media do not tell you the most important things going on in the world. The media focuses on events, but big problems are not events and progress against big problems happen slowly, not in events.</br></br>

                    	We don't hear: what is terrible every day or what is getting slowly.</br>

                        <p>Why do we not know how the world is changing?</br>
                            One reason is that our news focus on single events – the special newsworthy things that happen on a particular day.</br>
                        With this focus, the news fails to show the things that happen every day. The slow things that continuously and persistently change our world.</br></br>
                        To highlight this media failure I wrote this "newspaper" frontpage here. It is a newspaper that could have been published on any day. The headlines of the 'Global Development Daily' were true on any average day in the last decades.</br>
                        If we weren't able to make progress it wouldn't matter to have a big picture perspective on the world. But since we can make progress it very much does matter.

                            
                            
                        </br></br>The world is changing very, very fast.</p>

                    	What motivates us is to share the knowledge that change is possible and the wealth of knowledge researchers around the world have brought together on how to make progress against the big problems we face.</br></br>

We know that it is possible to make the world a better place because in many important ways we already did it.</br></br> It is because the world still faces so many big problems that it’s important to write about how progress is possible and what we can achieve in the future."</i>
