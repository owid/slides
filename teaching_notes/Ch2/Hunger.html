                These teaching notes are part of a series of resources from Our World in Data.</br>They have been designed to support those interested in teaching and learning about global development, and they require no background knowledge.</br></br>  Here we touch on the following questions:</br> What is the number of undernourished people in the world and how is this changing? </br>What are the main causes and determinants of hunger and malnutrition? </br>What does this all mean in terms of policy?</br></br>

                     <figcaption>An individual is considered to be undernourished when their dietary caloric intake is less than their minimum requirements.</br></br> The number of undernourished people in the world has declined since 1991. However, in 2016 we have seen an increase back to the level of 2009. </br></br>  You can read more about how undernourishment is defined and measured <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#data-quality-definition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>; and you can read more about global and regional trends <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#undernourishment-over-time-by-world-region" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        <p>Undernourishment is still very common in sub-Saharan Africa: about 18% of the population in this region do not consume sufficient calories.
                        </br></br>
                        This is the region with the highest rates of undernourishment; but this is also the region where we have seen the largest progress in recent decades. 
                        </br></br>In the MENA region rates are lower, but there has been no progress.</br></br>On the whole, the world average has almost halved since 1991.</br></br><em>(Note: In this interactive chart you can click on the option "Add country" to plot numbers for any country or world region.

                        <p>Undernourished children are more prone to poor health outcomes, likely to have lower educational achievement, and to give birth to smaller infants in the future. </br></br>Malnutrition is also associated with lower economic status and labor market opportunities in adulthood.

                            </br></br>But famines, where people starve due to lack of available food, are also much less common today.

                        <p>If hunger prevented poor people from working and earning enough to buy sufficient food, we would see most people in poverty spending everything on food and necessities. This is rarely the case. 'Food poverty traps' seem to be uncommon.
                        
                    	</br></br>
                        Even for very poor people within low-income countries, food expenditures increase much less than one-for-one with household budgets (and even when extra income does lead to more food expenditure, this doesn't always imply more calories, but rather better-tasting calories).
                    	In India, for example, per capita consumption of calories has gone down while incomes have gone up (see <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/Food_and_Nutrition_in_India_Facts_and_Interpretations.pdf">Deaton and Dreze 2009</a>).

                    <figcaption>
                     <p>Malnutrition can arise from micro-nutrient deficiencies (i.e. lack of key vitamins and minerals which are consumed in small quantities).
                     </br></br>
                      Anemia is an important example of 'hidden hunger'.
                      </br></br>
                      Anemia is associated with low aerobic capacity, general weakness and lethargy, and in some cases (especially for pregnant women) it can be life-threatening.

                     <p> Micro-nutrient deficiencies can be met through judiciously balanced diets, or by taking fairly cheap supplements (e.g. pills) or fortified products (e.g. iodized salt).
                     </br></br>
                     This map shows the proportion of households who use iodized salt. As we can see, consumption remains very low in many low-income countries where iodized salt could make a huge difference.

                    <h4>The problem of nutrition requires thinking beyond quantity of food</h4> 
                    <h5>The quality of food matters a lot, but following a careful diet is expensive even if food is cheap (information, time, and 'mental space').</h5>

           			 <blockquote> "The benefits of good nutrition may be particularly strong for two sets of people who do not decide what they eat: unborn babies and young children... Small differences in investments in childhood nutrition (in Kenya, deworming costs $1.36 USD PPP per year; in India, a packet of iodized salt sells for $0.62 USD PPP; in Indonesia, fortified fish sauce costs $7 USD PPP per year) make a huge difference later on. This suggests that governments and international institutions need to completely rethink food policy. Although this may be bad news for American farmers, the solution is not to simply supply more food grains, which is what most food security programs are currently designed to do."</blockquote> <p>(Banerjee and Duflo, Poor Economics, Page 48)</p>
