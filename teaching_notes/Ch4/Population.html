                        <p>The world is approaching what the late Hans Rosling called “the age of peak child”: the moment in global demographic history at which the number of children in the world stops increasing. </br></br> The world has probably not reached 'peak child' yet. But as this chart shows, we are likely very close to a long flat peak; the number of children in the world will not increase much more. </br></br> Globally, this means there will be what is often called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_dividend" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"demographic dividend"</a>. There will likely be new economic opportunities, because the proportion of people in working age will rise as the proportion of the dependent young generation falls. At the country level, many nations have already seen benefits from this demographic change.</br></br>  <em>(Note: You can read more about "peak child" population in our blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/peak-child" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        <p>This chart shows the distribution of men and women across various age groups. These 'population pyramids' rely on data and projections from the UN. </br></br> The pyramid for 1950 looks like a pyramid: the base is wide and the top is narrow. This reflects the fact that there is a continuous risk of death from birth on and through all ages. </br></br> The pyramid in 2017 is wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, because <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality" rel="noopener" target="_blank">child mortality is falling</a>, so the risk of death is now more concentrated at older ages. </br></br>  In 2100 the pyramid will be almost like a box. There will be much less inequality in life expectancy – most people will survive young ages and deaths will tend to take place at an advanced age. </br></br>  <em>(Note: You can read more about population projections and global demographic changes in our entry <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#how-will-the-global-demography-change" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.)</em></p>

                        – Stage 1: Population is stable. There is high fertility and high mortality; so deaths and births cancel out.</br></br>
                            – Stage 2: Population grows rapidly. There is high fertility but low mortality.</br></br>
                            – Stage 3: Population growth slows down. Social norms adapt to the fact that children survive. Fertility declines with increasing education and labor opportunities of women.</br></br>
                            – Stage 4: Population growth stops. Low fertility catches up with low mortality.</br></br>
                            – Stage 5: Population potentially starts growing again. The evidence here is limited, but the idea is that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08230" rel="noopener" target="_blank">further social and economic opportunities may raise fertility again</a>.  </br></br>

                        <p>The choice of having a child requires parents, but especially mothers, to consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost" rel="noopener" target="_blank">opportunity costs</a> that come with children – e.g. risking health, lower earnings, etc. </br></br>  Education drastically affects opportunity costs, and because of this more educated women tend to have fewer children.</br></br>  This chart shows that there is a correlation between women's education and family size, across countries and time. Looking at variation within countries shows the same: more educated women in a country <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DHS-data-on-fertility-by-the-level-of-education.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tend to have fewer children</a>.</br></br>These correlations capture the direct effect of education on fertility, as well as other aspects, such as the fact that education often goes together with changes in social norms.</br></br> <em>(Note: You can read our review of the evidence supporting a causal link <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#empowerment-of-women" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here.</a>)</em></p>

                        <p>This chart shows that in countries with higher average national incomes, families tend to be smaller; and within countries, richer families also tend be smaller.</br></br>
                        This correlation is partly driven by a causal mechanism: income affects desired family size because in poor families children often take care of parents in old age and during times of need. But it also captures other things – like the fact that higher incomes often go together with better health and education.
                        </br></br> Some studies have looked at exogenous shocks to fertility (e.g. contraception campaigns), and they have found evidence consistent with the causal link (e.g. parents who have fewer children often expect lower money transfers in the future and hence save more in anticipation). </br></br> <em>(Note: You can read more about this in Chapter 4 of the book <a href="https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=qRs5DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Poor Economics</a>.)</em>  </p>

                        <p> Family size is partly determined by social norms and views on the role of women. </br></br>In many contexts discrimination is common and economic opportunities are scarce, so norms that limit women's options end up also having an impact on whether parents prefer having a boy.</br></br>A <a href="http://demo.ncaer.org/popuppages/EventDetails/E10Jan2009/neemrana-paper12.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">study</a> found that the introduction of cable television in India exposed people to new lifestyles, and this led to a decrease in son preference, an increases in women’s autonomy, and a decreases in fertility.</br></br><em>(Note: In India there is evidence of "missing girls" from sex-selective abortions, as well as evidence of the fact that couples’ often keep having kids until they get a boy - so there are millions of "less wanted girls" who are disfavored in terms of health and education. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unwanted-21-million-girls-economic-survey-5075935/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This short newspaper article</a> explains the issue of "missing" and "unwanted" girls in more detail.)</em> </p>

                        <p> In surveys on desired family size in which men and women are separately interviewed, men usually report a larger ideal family size and a lower demand for contraception than their wives. </br></br> In many countries there's a large number of women who do not want to get pregnant, but are not using contraception.</br></br>  Lack of access to contraceptives is often a reality. But the evidence shows that simply supplying contraceptives is not enough to guarantee usage. Changes in social norms and female empowerment are also necessary.</br></br> <em>(Note: Family planning policies are important even when they have no direct impact on fertility. In Colombia, for example, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.592.2095&rep=rep1&type=pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">increasing family planning alternatives</a> led to  changes in the age at which women had children, even though they had little effect on number of children.

                        <p>This chart plots fertility in China since 1945. It shows that fertility started to decline in 1970, long before the introduction of the one-child-policy. Taiwan, which is claimed by China as part of China, never introduced a one-child-policy but experienced the same decline.</br></br> There is similar evidence from other countries. In India, for example, the "sterilization camps" from the 1970s were ineffective - and it is possible they actually contributed to population growth in the long run by eroding trust in family planning policies. </br></br> <em>(Note: You can read more about coercive population control policies in our entry <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#coercive-policy-interventions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here.</a> And you can read more about India's sterilization camps in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1972317?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">this academic article.</a>)</em></p>

As we have shown here, policies that promote education, health and better economic and social opportunities for women, are effective population policies.
