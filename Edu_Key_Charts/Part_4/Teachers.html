                    <figcaption>
                        <p>Directly measuring teacher quality is difficult.</br></br>
                        A common approach is to rely on proxies, such as teacher characteristics (e.g. training, qualifications) and behaviour (e.g. absenteeism).</br></br>
                        This map shows the proportion of primary school teachers who are trained to teach. </br></br>
                        Although the data is patchy, it shows large gaps in some countries. In Ghana, for example, about half of the teachers lack the required pedagogical training.

                        </p>

                    <figcaption>
                        <p>...and these gaps are also large if we look at subject-specific qualifications rather than general pedagogical training,

                    <figcaption>
                        <p> In some countries, the share of teachers with training is high but the share with qualifications is low (e.g. Ethiopia). </br></br> In other countries the opposite is true, and the share of teachers with training is low but the share with qualifications is high (e.g. Niger).</br></br> And in some countries, such as Ghana and Sierra Leone, both training and qualifications are low.

                    <figcaption>
                        <p>Whether instructors are trained and qualified to teach depends, to a great extent, on the policies and incentives in place.</br></br>
                         With this in mind, the Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) ranks countries based on whether they have specific policies aimed at preparing teachers with training and experience. In some countries, teachers face little opportunities for professional development.
                         </br></br>The way education systems select, recruit, train and deploy teachers matters.

                    <p> However, evidence suggests that improving the quality of teachers is a necessary but insufficient condition to improving student learning in contexts where there are other binding coinstraints.</br></br> 
                    For example, systems that require teaching an overambitious curriculum are likely to fail independently of teacher skills. </br></br> This chart summarizes the effects of four different policy treatments within the so-called Teacher Community Assistant Initiative (TCAI) in Ghana.  The first two sets of estimates correspond to the test-score impacts of enabling community assistants to provide remedial instruction specifically to low-performing children. These results are consistent with findings from across Africa, suggesting that teaching at the right level causes better learning outcomes in a cost-effective way.</p>

                        <p> Do countries that spend more per student achieve better outcomes?</br></br> While there is a positive correlation across non-rich countries, the overall pattern shows that expenditure on education is not, in itself, a good predictor of education quality </br></br>

                        <p>Many countries use 'performance-based' pay systems that rely on student test scores. Even in countries where the national pay structure does not connect salary with student performance, performance-based pay may indirectly include student test scores as a measure of teacher performance (e.g. Finland).</p>

                        <p>Evidence from experimental interventions suggests pay-for-performance teacher contracts can improve learning outcomes.</br></br> But this does not mean that they are necessarily effective at achieving other objectives of time spent in school. </br></br>
                        In fact, it's important to recognise that mechanisms for increasing teachers’ intrinsic motivation (e.g. professional rewards that increase satisfaction and recognition) may be complementary to extrinsic (e.g. pay-for-performance) incentives.
