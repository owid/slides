                        	The comparison with the trajectories for the US and Western Europe shows how very ambitious the goal is. The world has to reduce the rate of child deaths much faster than these two regions when they were at the same level of child mortality.

                        This progress continues. </br></br>One of the main killers of children is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/malaria">malaria</a>. Here is the perspective on the global change in the last 15 years.</br></br>
                        In many parts of the world malaria has been eradicated (in the US in 1951) and around the world, malaria mortality figures are falling. In the last 15 years the number of malaria deaths was almost halved.</p>

<!-- So what should we do?!
	 =========== 
	Many aspects (case for optimism, below – that makes clear that we can achieve something, we are a great team), but one key ome: Make use of what we are doing here. Use the data!

	Use the data to get people engagaged (their view is worse than reality)
	Use data to keep governments accountable

<!-- How can we make use of the data?
	 ================================= 
	 Show the SDG Tracker
		Two uses of data:
			Data gets people excited about development (cause the reality is so much more positive than their perception)
			Data can keep governments accountable

						<h5>We need to take data on global development much more seriously.</h5>

						<p>The second reason why we need data: Statistics are a tool for social change. We need reliable, understandable data to put pressure on governments to achieve the development goals we have.</br></br>

                        <p>We built the <i>'SDG Tracker'</i>.</br></br>
