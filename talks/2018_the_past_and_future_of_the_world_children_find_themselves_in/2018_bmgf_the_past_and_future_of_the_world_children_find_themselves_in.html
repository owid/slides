                	<h4>Context of this presentation:</h4>
                <p>A life in poor health, in material conditions of extreme poverty, and with little opportunity for education was the life that almost all our ancestors lived in. This was no one’s fault in particular, these are simply the living conditions that we always live in. Certainly it is not the fault of the individual people who grow up in these poor conditions.</br></br>
If you live in a society of subsistence farmers there is no way for you to leave poverty, if you live in a society where infectious diseases are prevalent you are not able to protect yourself from it, and if there is no educational system that allows you to dedicate years of your life to learning how to read, write and understand the world then you won’t learn it. Poor living conditions cannot be changed individually, poor living conditions can only change for entire societies.</br></br>
If we are thinking about what is possible in the future we are thinking about what is possible for our children. For children even more than for adults it is true that the chances for your life depend very little about what you can do for yourself and very much on the circumstances that you are born in. This is the question that I am asking in this slide show: How did the conditions that children were born into change over the last decades and what can we hope for for our children?</br></br>
The way I want to look at this is by focussing how the circumstances in which children find themselves allow them to develop their potential. In societies with poor health their potential is cut short by debilitating diseases or in the worst cases an early death, in poverty children lack the material means and freedom from work to develop, and without access to education they lack the input required to learn and flourish.</br></br>
The focus of children is also a helpful perspective because if children develop well it has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvskMHn0sqQ">benefits for all of us</a> (link to a new video I made with 'Kurz Gesagt'). Children that never develop their full potential keep away from all of us what otherwise might be – no one will ever enjoy what their creativity could enable them to do, not the children themselves and not anyone else.</p></div>

                        <p>The number of children increased from less than 1 billion in 1950 to almost 2 billion today.</br>
                        In the future however this trend will not continue. The number of children in the world will hardly increase, we are close to 'peak child'.</br></br>

                        In my post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/peak-child">'When will the world reach 'peak child'?'</a> I discuss how uncertain these projections are and how investments in education today will result into a much smaller world population at the end of the century.</br></br>

                        The literature on the drivers of falling fertility I have recently summarized <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#what-explains-the-change-in-the-number-of-children-women-have">here</a>.

                        In many parts of the world malaria has been eradicated (in the US in 1951) and around the world, malaria mortality figures are falling. In the last 15 years the number of malaria deaths was almost halved.</p>

                        <p>But in many countries child mortality is still high and we know that children are dying from preventable diseases.</br></br>SDG 3.2 is to reduce reduce every country's child mortality to less than 2.5%. Projections by the <i>UN Population Division</i> show that almost no country in Sub-Saharan-Africa will achieve the SDGs.</p>

                        Countries with poor health will have to develop much faster than the UN projects and much, much faster than the countries that are rich today.</br></br>

                        [These projections and also the observations on child mortality are uncertain: The publications by the IHME differ from the UN:</br>

					Overriding differences in skills and effort, <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/income-inequality-and-citizenship">empirical research</a> finds that simply the place where people live explains two-thirds of the variation of individual incomes around the world. Your income depends much more on the level of income, education, health of the society you are born into than on your own efforts, no matter how hard you try.

If current trends continue extreme poverty will become an almost exclusively African problem – and the number of people in extreme poverty on the African continent will not fall much.</br></br>

                <p>We are in a strong position, to work on the big problems collectively. And this work is desperately needed, for many of the next generation there are still large obstacles to develop their potential. A premature death, lack of economic security, and little access to good edcuation are still very common.</p>

                	<h4>Conclusion of this presentation:</h4>
                <p>
The question that this presentation asked was ’What is hindering young people to reach their potential?’ and we saw a large positive development over the last two centuries.</br>
But at the same time it is very clear from looking at the data and the projections that we are facing large challenges – key development goals will not be met without a substantial improvement of past trajectories.</br></br>
But the rewards from these efforts would be large. Most importantly for the children of the next generation. </br>
But also for everyone else as their creativity and work would benefit everyone in the world, those currently in extreme poverty and those in the well-off places elsewhere.</br></br>
How many innovators could the world see if all children had chances to realize their potential? 
There are likely many Einsteins and Bill Gates living in poor villages today and it is about the change in living conditions which will decide whether they can reach their potential or whether they remain stuck in bad health, poverty, and without access to education.</p></div>
