                        But a child mortality rate of 4.5% still means that 11 children die every minute. There is obviously absolutely no reason to be complacent.

	Many aspects (case for optimism, below – that makes clear that we can achieve something, we are a great team), but one key ome: Make use of what we are doing here. Use the data!

	Use the data to get people engagaged (their view is worse than reality)

<!-- How can we make use of the data?
	 ================================= 
	 Show the SDG Tracker
		Two uses of data:
			Data gets people excited about development (cause the reality is so much more positive than their perception)
			Data can keep governments accountable

						<p>The second reason why we need data: Statistics are a tool for social change. We need reliable, understandable data to put pressure on governments to achieve the development goals we have.</br></br>

                        <small>It is coincidence that I was invited to speak here this week, but it is good timing as we just released the new verion of our website <a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/"><i>'SDG-Tracker.org'</i></a>.</br></br>
                        It is the first publication that allows policy makers and citizens around the world to see how the world is doing on the way to the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030.</br>
