                        The perceived global trend is one of global stagnation or even decline.</br></br>


                        Few have a positive view on how the world is changing.</br>

                        <p>For the future, very few people think that things will get better. If you ask people the question <i>"Over the next 15 years, do you think living conditions for people around the world will get better or worse?"</i> the majority expects stagnation or worsening.</br></br> 

                        Few people are optimistic about what is possible for future living conditions.</br>
                        If you look at this country by country, you see that particularly in rich countries, most people think that the world will be stagnating or getting worse.
