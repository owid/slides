                        <p>According to the <em>International Poverty Line</em>, people are considered to be in 'extreme poverty' if they live on less than $1.90 per day, or the equivalent amount after converting currencies and adjusting for price differences between countries. This is the definition used by the World Bank and many other international institutions.</p>
                        <p>About 700 million people in the world live below this low threshold. And about 4.7 billion people (more than half of the global population) live on less than 10 dollars per day. </br></br> <em>(Note: In this interactive chart you can click on the option "Change country" to plot numbers for any country or world region.)</em></p>

                        <p>If we focus on the <em>intensity</em> of poverty, we see a similar pattern: The countries where a large share of people live in extreme poverty are also the countries where people tend to have the largest shortfall from the poverty line (i.e. the 'poverty gap' is largest in these countries). </br></br> In other words: People below the <em>International Poverty Line</em> tend to have much worse living standards in low-income countries.</br></br> <em>(Note: In our map charts you can click on any country to display the time-series estimates in a line chart.)</em></p>

                        <p>In 1820 there were just under 1.1 billion people in the world, of which more than 1 billion lived in extreme poverty.</br></br>  Over the next 150 years, the decline of poverty was not fast enough to offset the very rapid rise of the world population, so the number of non-poor and poor people increased. </br></br> Since around 1970, however, we are living in a world in which the number of people who are not living in extreme poverty is rising, while the number of people who are living in extreme poverty is falling.</br></br> <em>(Note: You can read more about this in our article discussing <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#extreme-poverty-in-a-historical-perspective">extreme poverty in a historical perspective.</a>)</em></p>

                        <p> In fact, in today's rich countries a large share of the population lived in extreme poverty until fairly recently. </br></br>  Actually, in most of these countries the majority of the population lived in extreme deprivation only a few generations ago. Progress was made at a fast pace — in some cases even at a <em>constant</em> pace. </p>

                        <p>And this progress is not only about incomes moving marginally above the extreme poverty line. </br></br>  In recent decades the global poverty rate has been going down independently of whether we set the poverty line at 1.90 or 10 dollars per day.</br></br> <em>(Note: You can read more about this in our blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/poverty-at-higher-poverty-lines">"Extreme poverty is falling: How is poverty changing for higher poverty lines?"</a>)</em></p>

                        <h5>Social policy is important both because it can contribute to promote income growth, and because it often makes the wait for growth less painful.</h5>

                        <blockquote>“Economists (and other experts) seem to have very little useful to say about why some countries grow and others do not... Given that economic growth requires manpower and brainpower, it seems plausible, however, that whenever that spark occurs, it is more likely to catch fire if women and men are properly educated, well fed, and healthy, and if citizens feel secure and confident enough to invest in their children, and to let them leave home to get the new jobs in the city. It is also probably true that until that happens, something needs to be done to make that wait for the spark more bearable.”</blockquote> <p>(Banerjee and Duflo, Poor Economics, Page 270)</p>
