                        <p>In most countries, employment rates tend to be higher among adults with advanced education degrees. This chart shows this: It compares employment rates among workers with a high school degree (upper secondary education) against those with more advanced qualifications (tertiary education). </br></br> All countries in this dataset are below the diagonal parity line (except for Saudi Arabia where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Saudi_Arabia#Employment" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the labor market is very particular</a>). This means they have higher employment rates among those who are more educated.</br></br>  In some countries the differences are very large. In Slovakia, for instance, the employment rate for those with tertiary education is twice as large as the rate for those with secondary education. </br></br> <em>(Note: You can read more about how educational attainment is linked to labor market outcomes in the OECD report <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/education-at-a-glance-2017_eag-2017-en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Education at a Glance 2017</a>.)</em></p>

                        <p>People with more education tend to also have higher earnings when they are employed. The correlation is shown in this chart, where the bars represent earnings of tertiary-educated workers relative to the earnings of workers with a high school degree (upper secondary education). </br></br> As we can see, in Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica and Chile, those with advanced degrees earn more than twice as much as those with high school degrees. The average for the OECD shows an earning advantage of around 55%.

                       </br></br>Individuals with more education are different in many ways to individuals with less education, so we cannot attribute wage differences in this chart solely to education. But many careful econometric studies have shown that education does lead to higher earnings.

                        This chart plots GDP per capita against student test scores, which are a proxy for acquired skills. </br></br>It shows that students in richer countries tend to gain more skills at school.</br></br>
                        You can check that there is also a similar correlation over time: countries where skills grow, tend to also have economic growth.</br></br>
                        This is just a raw correlation between the two variables; but <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education#education-outcomes-predict-economic-growth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> there is evidence</a> that education quality correlates with economic growth, even after accounting for other variables, such as baseline levels of schooling and economic activity.
                        </br></br>
                        <em>(Note: There are no reliable estimates of the exact causal impact that education has on economic growth. This is both because establishing causality at the macro level is difficult, and because we are only starting to get reliable data on skills and learning outcomes. You can read more about this in our blog post <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education#private-returns-to-education" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here.</a>)</em>

                    <figcaption>
                        <p>The benefits from education spill over to many dimensions of life. For example, women’s education leads to lower child mortality because it contributes towards healthier habits and choices, including child spacing. </br></br> This chart shows the strong correlation between child mortality and educational attainment, across countries and time.</br></br>Each line in this plot represents a country. The horizontal axis shows average years of schooling, while the vertical axis shows child mortality rates. Countries with more education tend to have lower child mortality; and across time, increasing education tends to go together with lower child mortality.</br></br><em>(Note: You can read more about the causal effect of education on child mortality in our entry <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality#better-education-of-women-reduces-child-mortality" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here.</a></em>  </p>

                        Adults with higher qualifications are more likely to report desirable social outcomes, including good or excellent health, participation in volunteer activities, interpersonal trust, and political efficacy. These descriptive results are only correlations, but they hold after controlling for literacy, gender, age and monthly earnings.</br></br><em>(Note: You can read more about the determinants of interpersonal trust in our entry <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trust" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here.</a> And you can read more about the link between education and other social outcomes in our entry <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-rise-of-education#social-returns-to-education" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here.</a></em>  </p>

                        This map shows the proportion of primary school teachers who are trained to teach. </br></br>
                        Although the data is patchy, this chart shows large gaps in some countries. In Ghana, for example, about half of the teachers lack the required pedagogical training. </br></br> <em>(Note: Training gaps are also large if we look at <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/percentage-of-teachers-in-primary-education-who-are-qualified-both-sexes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">subject-specific qualifications</a> rather than general pedagogical training.

                        <p>In most poor countries school enrollment estimates from administrative records are much higher than student attendance estimates from household surveys. This partly reflects the fact that student absenteeism is common and significant. </br></br>In Ghana, for example, the enrollment rate in 2015 was 90%, while the attendance rate was 69%.</br></br> In Niger, Chad, Mali and Liberia, estimates suggest that less than half of the school-aged children attend primary school. </br></br> <em>(Note: Household surveys and administrative records are subject to measurement error. Because of this, the gap between enrollment and attendance is not a perfect measure of absenteeism. Indeed, as this chart also shows, in some countries attendance is higher than enrollment. )</em></p>

                        <p>This chart plots learning outcomes against government education expenditure per primary-school student. </br></br> As we can see, there is a clear correlation: richer countries tend to have higher government expenditure per pupil, and they also tend to have higher learning outcomes.</br></br> Interestingly, however, this chart also shows that some countries achieve similar average test scores with radically different levels of spending. For example, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo have similar average scores, but South Africa spends about 100 times more per student. </br></br> This dispersion shows that better education is not only about larger budgets. </br></br> <em>(Note: You can read more about this in our entry on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education#school-inputs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financing education</a>)</em></p>

                    <h5>The available evidence from policy experiments confirms that improving education quality requires thinking carefully about cost-effectiveness, and not only about budget size</h5> 

                     <blockquote> "For policymakers, the main message from the summary of the evidence is that a “business as usual” approach of expanding spending on education (most of which is spent on increasing fairly standard inputs into education) is unlikely to have much impact on improving learning outcomes beyond that predicted by the cross-country relationship between per capita income and learning outcomes. On the other hand, interventions that focus on improved and more effective pedagogy (especially providing foundational literacy and numeracy skills to the millions of first-generation learners who are falling behind the pace of curriculum), and on improved governance of the education system (especially teacher performance and accountability) are likely to yield considerably greater returns on increased spending."</blockquote> <p>(<a href="http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~kamurali/papers/Published_Book_Chapters/School_Education_Developing_Countries.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Glewwe and Muralidharan 2016</a>, Page 85)</p>
