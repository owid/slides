                These teaching notes are part of a series of resources from Our World in Data.</br>They have been designed to support those interested in teaching and learning about global development, and they require no background knowledge.</br></br>  Here we touch on the following questions:</br> How does the general health situation of people in poor countries compare to the health of people in rich countries? </br> How are population health outcomes changing over time? </br> How difficult is it to improve health outcomes in poor countries? </br>What does this all mean in terms of policy?</br></br>

                        <p>In low-income countries, the average number of years that a newborn infant can expect to live (under current mortality patterns) is much lower than in high-income countries. </br></br> Life expectancy ranges from just over 50 years in the poorest countries to over 80 years in the richest countries. </br></br>  You can read more about cross-country differences in life expectancy <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        <p>Child mortality has declined remarkably in all world regions. And since progress has been faster in the regions with the worst outcomes, we are also seeing convergence: the difference between the best-off and worst-off world regions was almost 30 percentage points in the 1950's and has reduced to less than 7 percentage points today. </br></br><em>(Note: In this interactive chart you can click on the option "Add country" to plot numbers for any country or world region.

						Lack of access to clean water affects health even when it doesn't kill you: repeated bouts of diarrhea during childhood permanently impair both physical and cognitive development. </br></br> 
						This map shows death rates attributed to unsafe water. Roughly speaking, it shows us the number of deaths from drinking unclean water relative to the size of the population in each country.

                        <p>Between October 2002 and April 2003 researchers conducted a cross-country study to measure absenteeism among health providers (doctors, nurses, etc.). This chart shows their results. They found that in India, for example, 40% of health workers were absent from their job at the time of an unannounced spot check. </br></br> This is evidence of a complicated reality: In low-income countries doctors and health providers in primary health centers are often absent from their job. </p>

                        <p>As this chart shows, doctors often spend little time with patients.</br></br>And it's not only about time: in many cases doctors are simply not qualified to do their job.</br></br> In a test of medical competence for doctors in urban Delhi, a study found that in the majority of cases, formal and informal doctors would recommend a course of action that, based on the assessment of an external expert panel, was more likely to do harm than good. The unqualified private doctors were by far the worst, particularly those who worked in poor neighborhoods (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387805000027">Das and Hammer 2005)</a>.</p>

                     <blockquote> "The poor seem to be trapped by the same kinds of problems that afflict the rest of us – lack of information, weak beliefs, and procrastination among them. It is true that we who are not poor are somewhat better educated and informed, but the difference is small because, in the end, we actually know very little, and almost surely less than we imagine. Our real advantage comes from the many things that we take as given. We live in houses where clean water gets piped in—we do not need to remember to add Chlorine to the water supply every morning. The sewage goes away on its own—we do not actually know how."</blockquote> </blockquote> <p>(Banerjee and Duflo, Poor Economics, Page 77)</p>

                        <p>Most countries have increased health outcomes as they have increased spending on health care (and at any point in time, countries with higher spending also tend to have better outcomes).</br></br>  This correlation suggests that structural, macro policies can play a role in improving health outcomes, particularly in poor countries where baseline levels of spending are low.</br></br> But health care spending is of course not the only driver of health outcomes. In the US, for example, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-vs-health-expenditure" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> spending has gone up without a substantial improvement in outcomes</a>. </br></br>  You can read more about the link between health care spending and health outcomes  <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare#health-returns-to-healthcare-investment" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> </p>

                        <p>Vaccination campaigns are a concrete example of a macro-level health intervention that has been shown to work. </br></br>The WHO estimates that vaccinations today avert <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs378/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2 to 3 million deaths every year</a>.</br></br>  And historical returns have been huge: Large-scale vaccination campaigns enabled the world to eradicate smallpox. As this chart shows, we went from hundreds of thousands of cases every year, to complete eradication in only a couple of decades.</br></br> You can read more about the eradication of smallpox <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h5>Incentives of providers, as well as patient-level interventions are also very important</h5>

                    <h5>Small incentives that nudge people to act today, rather than indefinitely postpone, can have large positive effects. Regulation of health providers and subsidies to drastically lower prices can also help substantially.</h5>
                    <blockquote> "We should recognize that no one is wise, patient, or knowledgeable enough to be fully responsible for making the right decisions for his or her own health. For the same reason that those who live in rich countries live a life surrounded by invisible nudges, the primary goal of health-care policy in poor countries should be to make it as easy as possible for the poor to obtain preventive care, while at the same time regulating the quality of treatment that people can get."</blockquote> </blockquote> <p>(Banerjee and Duflo, Poor Economics, Page 78)</p>
