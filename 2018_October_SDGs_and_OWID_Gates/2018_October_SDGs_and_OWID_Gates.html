                            One reason is that our news focus on single events – the special newsworthy things that happen on a particular day.</br>
                        With this focus, the news fails to show the things that happen every day. The slow things that continuously and persistently change our world.</br></br>
                        To highlight this media failure I wrote this "newspaper" frontpage here. It is a newspaper that could have been published on any day. The headlines of the 'Global Development Daily' were true on any average day in the last decades.</br>

                        We did not achieve most of the MDGs.</br>

Overall, the world achieved 3 and a half targets: </br>
– MDG Target 1.A – halving the share of the world population living in extreme poverty.</br>
– MDG 3: the gender disparity in education was closed at the global level. </br>
– MDG Target 6.C on malaria and tuberculosis: achieved as the world was able to reduce the global rate of new infections. </br>
– Half of MDG 7: while the goal for sanitation was missed, the world did reach the goal on providing access to safe drinking water.

<!-- How can we make use of the data?
	 ================================= 
	 Show the SDG Tracker
		Two uses of data:
			Data gets people excited about development (cause the reality is so much more positive than their perception)
			Data can keep governments accountable

						<h5>We need to take data on global development much more seriously.</h5>

						<p>The second reason why we need data: Statistics are a tool for social change. We need reliable, understandable data to put pressure on governments to achieve the development goals we have.</br></br>

                        <small>It is coincidence that I was invited to speak here this week, but it is good timing as we just released the new verion of our website <a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/"><i>'SDG-Tracker.org'</i></a>.</br></br>
                        It is the first publication that allows policy makers and citizens around the world to see how the world is doing on the way to the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030.</br>
