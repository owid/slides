                <p>The slides in the following presentation, produced by the team at Our World in Data, are provided as a teaching resource to complement the book <em>Poor Economics</em>, by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.</br></br> Here we follow the main points from the third chapter, titled "Low-Hanging Fruit for Better (Global) Health?". This chapter covers the link between poverty and health. </br></br> You find a links to slides for other chapters in this <a href="https://owid.cloud/slides/Poor_Economics/ToC/ToC.html">Table of Content</a>.</p>

                        <p> Life expectancy is shorter: The average number of years that a newborn infant can expect to live under current mortality patterns is much lower in low-income countries. 
                        </br></br> <em>(Note: In this interactive map you can use the slider at the bottom to show estimates for any year. And you can click on any country to plot a time series for that country.)</em></p>

                    <figcaption>
                        <p>Child mortality is higher: In many low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, a much larger share of children die before their fifth birthday.

                        <p>The burden of diseases is higher: If we combinde data on mortality and years lived with poor health due to disability and illness, we see again that people in low-income countries tend to have much worse health outcomes.

                        <p>HIV/AIDS, Malaria, diarrheal diseases and conditions related to diet (malnutrition, nutritional defficiencies, etc.) are all relatively easy to prevent (and in some cases also treat).

                        <p>Three cheap “miracle drugs” could already save thousands of children: chlorine for purifying water; and salt and sugar, the key ingredients of rehydration solutions. </br></br> 
                        Lack of access to clean water affects health even when it doesn't kill you: repeated bouts of diarrhea during childhood permanently impair both physical and cognitive development.</p>

In a test of medical competence for doctors in urban Delhi, a study found that in the majority of cases, formal and informal doctors would recommend a course of action that, based on the assessment of an external expert panel, was more likely to do harm than good. The unqualified private doctors were by far the worst, particularly those who worked in poor neighborhoods (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387805000027">Das and Hammer 2005)</a>.</p>

                <h3>Why demand low-quality treatment and at the same time show indifference toward preventive services?</h3>

               <section>
                    <h4>Behavioural biases</h4>
                    <h5>Lack of information, lack of strategies to avoid procastination, beliefs held for convenience and comfort in the absence of better alternatives</h5>
                     <blockquote> "The poor seem to be trapped by the same kinds of problems that afflict the rest of us – lack of information, weak beliefs, and procrastination among them. It is true that we who are not poor are somewhat better educated and informed, but the difference is small because, in the end, we actually know very little, and almost surely less than we imagine. Our real advantage comes from the many things that we take as given. We live in houses where clean water gets piped in—we do not need to remember to add Chlorin to the water supply every morning. The sewage goes away on its own—we do not actually know how."</blockquote> </blockquote> <p>(Banerjee and Duflo, Poor Economics, Page 77)</p>
            </section> 

            <section data-transition="slide" >
                <h3> What does this imply for policy?</h3>
            </section>

               <section>
                    <h4>There is a case for subsidies, regulation, and 'nudges'</h4> 
                    <h5>Small incentives that nudge people to act today, rather than indefinitely postpone, can have large positive effects. Regulation of health providers and subsidies to drastically lower prices can also help substantially.</h5>
                    <blockquote> "We should recognize that no one is wise, patient, or knowledgeable enough to be fully responsible for making the right decisions for his or her own health. For the same reason that those who live in rich countries live a life surrounded by invisible nudges, the primary goal of health-care policy in poor countries should be to make it as easy as possible for the poor to obtain preventive care, while at the same time regulating the quality of treatment that people can get."</blockquote> </blockquote> <p>(Banerjee and Duflo, Poor Economics, Page 78)</p>
