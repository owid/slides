                    	Every day 15,000 children die. Child mortality is an everyday tragedy of enormous scale that rarely makes the headlines (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-everyday-tragedy-no-headlines">read the post</a>).</br></br>


                    	The newspapers and media do not tell you the most important things going on in the world. The media focuses on events, but big problems are not events and progress against big problems happen slowly, not in events.</br></br>

                    <figcaption>
                        <p>Why do we not know how the world is changing?</br>
                            One reason is that our news focus on single events – the special newsworthy things that happen on a particular day.</br>
                        With this focus, the news fails to show the things that happen every day. The slow things that continuously and persistently change our world.</br></br>
                        To highlight this media failure I wrote this "newspaper" frontpage here. It is a newspaper that could have been published on any day. The headlines of the 'Global Development Daily' were true on any average day in the last decades.</br>
                        If we weren't able to make progress it wouldn't matter to have a big picture perspective on the world. But since we can make progress it very much does matter.

                            
                            
                        </br></br>The world is changing very, very fast.</p>
