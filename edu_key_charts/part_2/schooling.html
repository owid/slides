                            If you press 'play', in the bottom left corner, you'll see the evolution of the same variable, from 1870 to 2010.

                        </br></br> While in 1870 there were just a few countries in which the average person had more than 4 years of education, today there are few countries in which the population has less education than that.

                            This chart shows the female-to-male ratio of average years of education. </br></br>
                            In 'Advanced Economies', in 1870, women received only 0.75 years of education for every year of education that men received. By 2010 this gap was closed in these countries. </br></br> Across the world, gender gaps in years of schooling have narrowed. In some regions the gap has even reversed.

                            In most countries almost no child was enrolled in school. And even in the best-off countries the majority of children did not attend primary education.</br></br>

                        <p>In recent decades the world has made progress in reducing the number of out-of-school children.</br></br>
                            From a peak of 112 million out-of-school children worldwide in 1997, the number almost halved to 60 million children.

                            By clicking on the relative button it can be seen that more than every second out-of-school child lives in Africa.

                        Some countries in central Africa and Asia have low enrollment rates, between 50% and 80%.
