                        <p>Increasing the share of renewables in our energy mix is essential to low-carbon development.</p>
                        <p>18% of global energy demand is met by renewable technologies.</p>
                        <p>By selecting the 'map' tab on the chart you can explore this by country.</p>
                        <p>Lower-income countries tend source more of final energy from renewables with a reliance on traditional bioenergy.</p>

                        <p>This chart shows the homicide death rate, measured as the number of homicides per 100,000 people of a given country.</p>
                        <p>Hovering over a country shows its given percentage. Clicking on a country shows how this has changed over time.</p>
                        <p>Homicide deaths are largely geographically focused.</p>

                        <p>In Western Europe, homicide rates have declined around 100-fold over the long-term.</p>
