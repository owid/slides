                        <p>The most widely discussed quantitative assessment of the quality of education comes from the PISA study, which is run by the OECD.</br></br>

                        The 'Programme for International Student Assessment' (PISA) assesses the performance of 15-year old school pupils’ performance on mathematics, reading and science examinations.</br></br>

                            This map shows the latest round of results on mathematics.

                        <p>This map shows the latest round of results on mathematics.</br></br>
                            The mean for participating OECD countries set to 500 points and the standard deviation is set to equal 100 points.</br>
                            This means that the difference between countries can be substantial. Brazilian students with an average score of 400 points in mathematics are on average one standard deviation below the performance of the OECD countries. And the results of Peru, Algeria, Tunesia, Lebanon, Macedonia, and the Kosovo are worse still.

                        <p>To describe the distribution of proficiency within countries PISA segments the achieved outcomes into levels of proficiency.</br></br>To achieve higher levels, students need to be able to solve tasks of increasing complexity. The results are then reported as the share of the student population that reached each level.</br></br>The visualization shows the distribution of students proficiency levels in 2009, 2012, and 2015.</br></br>It is possible to see the data for other countries by choosing the 'change country' option below the visualization.</p>

                        <p>This map reports the results of the 'Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study' (TIMSS).</br></br>

As the name says, TIMSS is an assessment of the mathematics and science knowledge of students. </br></br>

While PISA selects the assessed students by age and focusses on 15-year olds, TIMMS selects students by the grade they attend and tests students in Grades 4, 8, and in their final year.</br>

                        <p>With a multitude on different assessments of learning outcomes which focus on different geographical areas and different skills it is an obvious idea to try to combine these measures into a common system to get a more comprehensive perspective on educational outcomes across the world.</br></br>
                            The comibantion of results from educational achievement tests by the education economists Eric Hanushek and Ludger Wößmann are shown here.
