                        </br></br>Women's access to education is one very important driver of lower fertility rates.

                        But with much lower fertility, the UN expects the number of children to peak in 2057 at 2.094 billion children and by the end of the century the number of children is projected to be at 1.97 billion, just the same as today.</p>

                        <p>The distribution of children will however change: This chart shows how the UN projections for the number of school-age-children break down by world regions.</br></br>
                        Asia had to provide for a population of under-15-year-olds that doubled in size in less than 50 years, but over the coming decades this population will decrease in size.</br></br>
                    In the future, Africa is projected to see a very large increase of school-age-children. Not quite as large as the increase in Asia, but still almost a doubling until the end of the century.</br></br>
                    How this will turn out however will depend substantially on how successfully women are given access to education on the African continent in the short run.</br></br>
                    On a global scale the challenges for education in the last century were very different from the challenges ahead.

                        <p>The demographers at IIASA are producing global demographic projections in which the various scenarios differ in how rapdily global education can be improved.</br></br>

                        As this visualization shows, the impact of different assumptions about education expansion are very large:</br>
                    The faster education can be made available, the faster the world will see a slow-down in population growth. Reasonable scenarios can make a difference of almost 1 billion people as early as 2060.</br></br>

                        <p>Africa is the continent where the UN and IIASA demographers differ most substantially. The UN projects a population of 4.5 billion in Africa in 2100 – see <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-of-all-world-regions-including-the-un-projection-until-2100">this visualization</a>.</br></br>
                            The IIASA researchers, whose projection is shown here on the left, on the other hand project an end of rapid population growth in Africa by the end of the century when the population will reach 2.6 billion people. A difference of almost 2 billion people.

                            A fast expansion of education is projected to lead to half the size of the under-15-year-old population as compared to a stagnation at the current enrollment rates.

                        Historical estimates suggest that 200 years ago around 83% of the world population older than 15 years had no formal education at all. Today these ratios have swapped so that only 14% of today's world population had no formal education at all.</p>

                        <p>The map shows the estimates of the average years of schooling in the world in 1870.</br>

                            In the map for 2010 we see how much the world has changed.</br></br>
                            It is also possible to click on any country to see the change over time. While in 1870 there were just a few countries in which the average person had more than 4 years of education, today there are few countries in which the population has less education than that.

                            This chart shows the female-to-male ratio of average years of education. </br>
                            In 'Advanced Economies' women received only 0.75 years of education for every year of education that men received. In 2010 the gender inequality was eradicated in these countries. In other world regions the inquality between women and men was considerably worse in the past and in all regions the inequality declined.

                            From a peak of 112 million out-of-school children worldwide in 1997, the number almost halved to 60 million children.</br></br>
                            By clicking on the relative button it can be seen that more than every second out-of-school child lives in Africa.

                        Some countries in central Africa and Asia have low enrollment rates, between 50% and 80%.

                        <p>In 1970 the gender gap in primary education was very large in some African and Asian countries, as you see in this map.</br></br>
                            If you press 'Play' – in the bottom left corner below the map – you can see how the world has changed since then.
                            Today the gender gap in primary education is very small in most countries. Exceptions are central African and Asian countries where sometimes only 4 out of 10 enrolled primary students are female.

                        The map shows the world in 1970 – by moving the time slider to the righy you can see how the world has changed.</br></br>
                        In some countries between 10% and 30% of the population have tertiary education. In many African, Asian, and Latin American countries the share of the population that completed tertiary education is lower than 5%.

                        Finally let's look at some of the correlates of educational attainment.</br></br>
                            Countries that are richer tend to be countries in which the population has attained educational institutions for a longer time.

                        With the exception of 'Middle East & Nothern Africa' the share of undernourished people declined since 1990 in all world regions. In Sub-Saharan-Africa still one out of 5 people is undernourished.</p>
