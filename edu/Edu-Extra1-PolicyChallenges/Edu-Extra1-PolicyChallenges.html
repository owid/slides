                        This chart shows the relationship between test scores and growth after accounting for baseline levels of schooling and GDP. As we can see, there is a strong positive relationship.</br></br>

                        A number of studies have found that it is actually education in the form of cognitive skills, rather than mere school attainment, what really matters for predicting individual earnings and economic growth.

                        In all countries individuals with tertiary education were by far the group most likely to report trusting others. And in almost every country, those with post-secondary non-tertiary education were more likely to trust others than those with primary or lower secondary education.

                        <p>This chart shows how the UN projections for the number of school-age-children break down by world regions.</br></br>
                    In the future, Africa is projected to see a very large increase of school-age-children. Not quite as large as the increase in Asia in past decades, but still almost a doubling until the end of the century.</br></br>
                    How this will turn out however will depend substantially on how successfully women are given access to education on the African continent in the short run.</br></br>
                    On a global scale the challenges for education in the last century were very different from the challenges ahead.

                        <p>The demographers at IIASA are producing global demographic projections in which the various scenarios differ in how rapdily global education can be improved.</br></br>

                        As this visualization shows, the impact of different assumptions about education expansion are very large:</br>
                    The faster education can be made available, the faster the world will see a slow-down in population growth. Reasonable scenarios can make a difference of almost 1 billion people as early as 2060.</br></br>
