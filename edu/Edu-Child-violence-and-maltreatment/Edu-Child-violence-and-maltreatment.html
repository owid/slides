                    <figcaption>
                        <p>Working children are often out of school. This is not surprising: Time is a scarce resource, so for many children who spend substantial time working it is difficult to attend school.</p>

                        <p>Indeed, in countries where children tend to work longer hours, it is more common that working children remain out of school.  In fact, there are academic studies that provide evidence in support of a causal relationship: Work often does cause children to remain or drop out of school.</p>

                        <p>This chart shows the negative correlation between incomes and child labor. Conceptually, there are reasons why this relationship might be causal (e.g. children may only work if unable to meet subsistence conditions). </br> Partly following this logic, several countries have implemented cash transfer programmes to discourage child labour and increase schooling.
                       </br></br>These “collaborative measures” against child labour have shown positive effect (more details <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor/#child-labour-and-income" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>).

                        <p>Sexual violence against children is extremely difficult to capture in data, since many victims are not able or willing to report their situation. However, available estimates of self-reported sexual victimization show that this is an extremely common tragedy.</p>

                <h1>5) Linking violence and education</h1>

                  <p>Children who are victims of abuse and neglect, at home or at school, tend to have worse education outcomes.</br></br>
This correlation can be partly explained by the impact of violence on mental and physical health. Hormones associated with violence, such as cortisol, can inhibit physical growth and the children’s susceptibility to illness. And it is also the case that these hormones can impair the development of neural connections in parts of the brain that are critical for learning. Violence in the early years can undermine lifelong health, learning, and behavior. </br></br>
Moreover, the interaction between violence and education operates in both directions. This means education can be used as an instrument to reduce the prevalence of violence.</p>
