                        But a child mortality rate of 4.5% still means that 11 children die every minute. There is obviously absolutely no reason to be complacent.

                        <p>Why do we not know how the world is changing?</br>
                            One reason is that our news focus on single events – the special newsworthy things that happen on a particular day.</br>
                        With this focus, the news fails to show the things that happen every day. The slow things that continuously and persistently change our world.</br></br>
                        To highlight this media failure I wrote this "newspaper" frontpage here. It is a newspaper that could have been published on any day. The headlines of the 'Global Development Daily' were true on any average day in the last decades.</br>

</br></br>
                            <small>
                        We did not achieve most of the MDGs.</br>

Overall, the world achieved 3 and a half targets: </br>
– MDG Target 1.A – halving the share of the world population living in extreme poverty.</br>
– MDG 3: the gender disparity in education was closed at the global level. </br>
– MDG Target 6.C on malaria and tuberculosis: achieved as the world was able to reduce the global rate of new infections. </br>
– Half of MDG 7: while the goal for sanitation was missed, the world did reach the goal on providing access to safe drinking water.

                        The difference however between the projected path and the path required for the SDGs shows that the world is moving in the right direction, but not fast enough.

<!-- How can we make use of the data?
	 ================================= 
	 Show the SDG Tracker
		Two uses of data:
			Data gets people excited about development (cause the reality is so much more positive than their perception)
			Data can keep governments accountable

						<h5>We need to take data on global development much more seriously.</h5>

						<p>The second reason why we need data: Statistics are a tool for social change. We need reliable, understandable data to put pressure on governments to achieve the development goals we have.</br></br>

                        <small>It is coincidence that I was invited to speak here this week, but it is good timing as we just released the new verion of our website <a href="https://sdg-tracker.org/"><i>'SDG-Tracker.org'</i></a>.</br></br>
                        It is the first publication that allows policy makers and citizens around the world to see how the world is doing on the way to the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030.</br>
